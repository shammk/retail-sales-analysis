📈 Visual Highlights
Below are the key visualizations used to explore sales performance and profitability.
(Insert each uploaded image under its heading.)

1. Revenue & Profit by Region

This comparison highlights:

North leads in both revenue and profit

East and South show moderate, stable performance

West generates strong revenue but slightly lower profit, suggesting margin pressure

2. Revenue by Product

Key observations:

Laptops and Phones dominate revenue

Tablets and Monitors form the mid‑tier

Headphones contribute the least, indicating potential for repositioning

3. Monthly Revenue Trend

Seasonal patterns include:

Peaks around March and July

Dips around June and November

Overall stable performance with predictable fluctuations

4. Sales Channel Distribution

A nearly even split:

Online: 51%

In‑Store: 49%

This indicates a strong digital presence and opportunities for further online growth.

5. Average Revenue & Profit by Discount Level

Clear trend:

Both revenue and profit decline as discounts increase

Profit drops more sharply

Confirms that aggressive discounting erodes margins

6. Average Profit Margin by Product

Insights:

Profit margins are consistent across products

Indicates stable pricing and cost structures

Useful for identifying premium‑pricing opportunities

🧠 Key Insights
Bringing all analyses together:

North is the strongest region overall

West shows high revenue but weaker margins

Laptops and Phones are the primary revenue drivers

Seasonal peaks suggest opportunities for targeted campaigns

Online sales slightly outperform in‑store

Discounting has a clear negative impact on profitability

Profit margins are stable across product categories

💡 Recommendations
Based on the findings:

1. Optimise Discount Strategy
Reduce unnecessary discounting in categories where profit erosion is highest.

2. Strengthen Online Channel Strategy
Online is already leading — invest further in digital marketing and UX.

3. Promote High‑Margin Products
Use targeted campaigns to shift demand toward higher‑margin items.

4. Review Cost Structure in the West Region
Strong revenue but weaker profit suggests operational inefficiencies.

5. Leverage Seasonal Peaks
Increase inventory and marketing around March and July.
